Hello!

Thank you for trying out my program!
You can download the full program (website) here and run it on a live server to use it.
The program is by no means complete yet,
However I do plan to keep adding to it. You can use your own database of plant species etcetera and put it in the code.
I have added some instructions in the code itself but I do plan to put them on the GitHub aswell in the Future.
